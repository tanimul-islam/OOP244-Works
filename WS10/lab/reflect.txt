Function templates in C++ are a powerful tool that enables the creation of versatile and reusable functions capable of working with multiple data types. They allow developers to write a single template function that can perform similar operations on different types of data, eliminating the need for redundant code. In this workshop, two function templates are showcased: search and listArrayElements. The search template performs a linear search within an array of objects for a specified key value. It uses the overloaded equality comparison (==) operator to determine matches and adds them to a Collection. The listArrayElements template displays elements from an array using the output stream insertion (<<) operator. Function templates enhance code modularity and efficiency by adapting the same logic for various data types. They simplify development, reduce code duplication, and ensure a consistent approach to similar tasks across different contexts. However, caution is advised when using operator overloading, as behavior can vary depending on data types.
