that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.*/

In this workshop, i get introduced to the rule of three in C++ programing. The "Rule
of Three" is a guideline in C++ that states that if a class defines one or more of the following three functions, it should explicitly define all three of them: the copy constructor, the copy assignment operator, and the destructor. This rule ensures proper management of resources and prevents issues such as memory leaks and double deallocations. In the absence of an appropriately defined copy constructor, the destructor is executed twice when it should only execute once. This duplicate execution is a source for trouble. In this workshop, we create copy constructor (TextFile::TextFile(const TextFile& source), assignment constructor(TextFile& TextFile::operator=(const TextFile& incomingTxt)) & destructor(TextFile::~TextFile()) by implementing all three of these functions, the TextFile class ensures that it properly manages resources when objects are copied, assigned, or destroyed. This adherence to the Rule of Three helps prevent issues related to memory management and resource leaks, providing a robust and reliable class implementation.
