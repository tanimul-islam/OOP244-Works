Constructors and destructors are essential concepts in object-oriented programming and play a crucial role in managing the lifecycle of objects. In this workshop, I learned these two terms closely with practice.
Constructors: Constructors are special member functions that are called when an object of a class is created. They are responsible for initializing the object's data members and setting up the object's initial state. In the given code, the constructor's Label(), Label(const char*), and Label(const char*, const char*) are used to initialize the Label objects with appropriate values. Constructors ensure that the object is properly initialized before it can be used.
Destructors: Destructors are also special member functions, but they are called when an object is about to be destroyed or goes out of scope. Destructors are responsible for cleaning up any resources the thing allocates, such as freeing dynamically allocated memory or releasing system resources. In the given code, the destructor ~Label() is used to delete the dynamically allocated memory for the frame line string to avoid memory leaks.
