Completing this workshop on derived classes and resources in C++ has been an enriching learning experience. Throughout the workshop, I gained valuable insights into essential topics such as object-oriented programming, inheritance, file handling, and resource management.The workshop were well-structured, and I successfully implemented the Text and HtmlText classes. In the Text class, I learned how to load text from a file using ifstream and output the content to an ostream. Building on this foundation, the HtmlText class, derived from Text, allowed me to add HTML-specific functionalities, including title handling and conversion of special characters to HTML entities. One of the main challenges I faced during the project was correctly converting special characters to HTML entities while ensuring proper spacing and formatting. Additionally, managing resources, such as handling file streams appropriately to avoid leaks or locking issues, required attention to detail. By overloading the << operator for both classes, I achieved seamless integration with standard C++ streams, enabling easy output of the content using cout. Overall, the project emphasized the importance of code reusability through inheritance and the significance of efficient resource management. Debugging and thorough testing played a vital role in ensuring the correctness of the program. This workshop has significantly enhanced my understanding of C++'s object-oriented features and resource handling techniques. I feel more confident in building well-structured and maintainable programs, making me a more proficient C++ programmer.
